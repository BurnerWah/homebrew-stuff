# Homebrew stuff
This repository contains some random homebrew formulas I use.
They're meant primarily to automate the process of building software.
They assume requirenments have already been satisfied by your system's package manager.
If you can't use them, that's probably because I didn't actually figure out what the dependencies of a package should be.

I'll probably end up abandoning a lot of things in here as they become available elsewhere (apt, snaps, good brew packages, using arch linux) so don't rely on this for anything.
